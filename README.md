# php-img-resize
This repository includes an end to end demo code for uploading a file and resizing it.

For simplicity the final desired size is configured in a file in the path: "configs/image.php".

AJAX has been used to send the request to server for uploading the image.

Only JPG/JPEG/PNG files are considered for now.
